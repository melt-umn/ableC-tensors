# ableC-tensors

## Tensor extension for ableC, inspired and helped by Single Assignment C (SAC), MATLAB and Julia

TODO: overview of purpose and function of product

## Usage

TODO: write the TODO section :D 

## Installation

### Requirements

To use the ableC-tensors extension, first make sure to install [ableC](https://github.com/melt-umn/ableC) and [silver](https://github.com/melt-umn/silver) (put them in the same directory!). I put their shared directory directly on my desktop, but the location should not matter.

### Installation

In the same directory as ableC and silver, create an `extensions` folder (if you have created this folder before, enter the one you have). The ableC-tensors repository (and any other up-to-date ableC extension) should be downloaded in this folder. This can be done two main ways: 

1. To clone this repository, open up your terminal and enter the extensions folder. Then, type `git clone git@github.umn.edu:melt/ableC-tensors.git` and the repository will download.

2. To manually download this repository, you can click the green "Clone or download" button on this page's github (https://github.umn.edu/melt/ableC-tensors TODO: move to public github) and then click "Download ZIP". Unpack this ZIP file in the extensions folder.

## Credits

This extension was primarily coded by Ankit Siva and Zoe Wentzel, with assistance from Nathaniel Ringo and Travis Carlson. In addition, it was inspired by the incomplete (and private) Matlab ableC extension coded by Sean Geronimo Anderson and Nguyen Nguyen.

## Contact

For basic questions on using or understanding the extension, email Zoe Wentzel at wentz101@umn.edu. If you are interested on improving and/or expanding the ableC-tensor extension, wish to create your own extension with ableC/silver (or already have and want to share it!), desire more information on ableC or silver, or anything else along those lines, contact Professor Van Wyk at evw@umn.edu.
